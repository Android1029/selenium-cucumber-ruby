selenium-cucumber : Automation Tesing Using Ruby

selenium-cucumber is a behavior driven development (BDD) approach to write automation test script to test Web and Android Apps.
It enables you to write and execute automated acceptance/unit tests.
It is cross-platform, open source and free.
Automate your test cases with minimal coding.

Documentation

* [Installation](doc/installation.md)
* [Predefined steps](doc/canned_steps.md)
* [selenium-cucumber API's](doc/selenium-cucumber-API.md)

Writing a test
--------------

The cucumber features goes in the `features` library and should have the ".feature" extension.

You can start out by looking at `features/my_first.feature`. You can extend this feature or make your own features using some of the [predefined steps](doc/canned_steps.md) that comes with selenium-cucumber.

Generate a Cucumber skeleton
----------------------------

To get started with selenium-cucumber you need to run `selenium-cucumber gen` command. This will create a cucumber skeleton in the current folder like this:

    features
        |
        |__support
        |     |__env.rb
        |     |__hooks.rb
        |
        |__step_definitions
        |     |__custom_steps.rb
        |
        |__platform_configs
        |     |__local_android_app_nexus5.yml
        |     |__saucelab_ios_app_iphone6.yml
        |     |__browserstack_windows_10ie.yml
        |
        |__app_under_test
        |     |__calculator.apk
        |     |__calculator.app
        |
        |__actual_images
        |
        |__expected_images
        |
        |__image_difference
        |
        |__screenshots
        |
        |__my_first.feature

Take a look at `my_first.feature` and change it to fit your web or android application.
